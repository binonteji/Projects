# Multi HandWritten Digit Recognizer

## Overview 
Hand Written Digit Recognition by the machine itself turns out to be a major prospect in the arena of fast computing and scientific field.Modelling up the gadget and to make electronic devices understand the basis of perception and cognize the human level activities in terms of comprehending the digit recognition can be complex.

## Description
The project aims to recognize and predict the handwritten digits that were drawn on Python's gaming Pygame library. The model was trained in Python on Google's Deep Learning library named Tensorflow using publically available MNIST dataset. Since, the problem turns out to be a Computer Vision problem; the Deep Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) assisted solving the problem. Finally, the algorithm helped classfying 10 digits using some image processing techniques using OpenCv.

## Libraries used:
* **Pygame**
* **Numpy**
* **OpenCv**
* **Tensorflow/Keras**

## Dataset 
The MNIST dataset is publically available that is also openly accessible on Tensorflow's top layer API named Keras, which consists of 70,000 labelled 28x28 grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images corresponding to 10 digit classes.

## Enchancement
Same can be implemented over the web browser and various devices. It is hoped that this application will inform practitioners to solve various computer vision problems with great anticipation.

## Download and use
1. Press download or clone this repository.
2. Extract it to your local location on computer.
3. Run **```button.py```** from **```Multi HandWritten Digit Recognizer```** folder on your terminal or console. Pygame will be opened.

4. Draw the digits above the black line and click OK button and inference will be done just above the black line in blue color.
